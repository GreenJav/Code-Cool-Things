# Code-Cool-Things
I really don't know how to show my trajectory in programming but I have a lot of code that I made in jobs or for fun that can be useful

1# Riemann Calculator - A calculator for Riemann's Sum using the left, right, trapezoid methods. The language is in Java and the graphical interface was made with the help of NetBeans. Certainly, there are some bugs and I think an incomplete but fun and at the same time very tiring project to do

2# Tower of Hanoi  - Done as a group is the reproduction of the game Tower of Hanoi but without using a graphical interface, even so, we try to show something visual. C Language.

3# Data structure - Some codes with data structures

4# Python Codes - Some python codes bruh

5# Java Codes - Some java codes bruhÂ²

6# TrabAnalise - A folder with some very interesting sorting algorithms made for a data analysis assignment
